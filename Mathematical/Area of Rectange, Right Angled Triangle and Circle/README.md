Calculate the area of rectangle, right angled triangle and circle.

#### Input:
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows the description of testcase. Each testcase contains 5 space separated positive integers denoting the length of rectangle, width of rectangle, base of right angled triangle, perpendicular of right angled triangle and radius of circle respectively.

#### Output:
For each testcase, output a single line containing 3 space separated integers denoting the area of rectangle, area of right angled triangle, and area of circle respectively.
Note: We need to print the floor values of the areas. Also take value of pi = 3.14
#### Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= length / breadth / base / perpendicular / radius  <= 103

#### Example:
#### Input:
1
32 32 54 12 52
#### Output:
1024 324 8490
