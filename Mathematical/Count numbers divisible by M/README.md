Given two numbers A and B which define a range, where A < B. Find the count of total numbers in the given range [A … B] divisible by 'M'.

#### Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains three space separated integers A, B and M.

#### Output:
For each test case, print the count of total numbers in the given range [A … B] divisible by 'M'.

#### Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=A<=103
A5

#### Example:
#### Input:
2
25 100 30
6 15 3
#### Output:
