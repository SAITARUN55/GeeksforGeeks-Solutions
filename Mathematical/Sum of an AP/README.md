Write a program to print sum of an Arithmetic Series with n terms with first term given as a and common difference d.

#### Input: 

The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. The first line of the test case will be the number of terms of AP and second line its first term and common difference.
#### Output:

For each test case, output will be the sum of AP 
#### Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= a,d <= 100

#### Example:
#### Input:

1
5
1 3

####Output: 
35
