Write a program to find the simple interest for given principal amount P, time Tm(in years) and rate R.

#### Input:
The first line of input contains an integer, the number of test cases T. Each test case should contains three lines input . First line contains P then Tm and R in the last line.

#### Output:
For each testcase in new line, print the floor value of the simple interest

#### Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= P <= 103
1 <= Tm <= 20
1 <= R <= 20


#### Example:
#### Input:
2
42
8
15
501
10
5

#### Output:
50
250

#### Explanation:
#### Testcase 1: Simple interest of given principal amount 42, in 8 years at a 15% rate of interest is 50.
