Given length l, width b and height h of a cuboid. The task is to find the total surface area and volume of cuboid.

#### Input:
The first line of the input contains T, denoting the number of testcases. Each of the next T lines contains three space separated positive integers l, b, h denoting the length, width and height of cuboid in same line separated by space.

#### Output:
For each testcase in new line, output two space separated integers denoting surface area and volume of cuboid respectively.

#### Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= l, b, h <= 103

#### Example:
#### Input:
1
1 2 3

#### Output:
22 6

#### Explanation:
#### Testcase 1: total surface area for the given cuboid is 22 and its volume 6.
