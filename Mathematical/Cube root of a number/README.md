Given a number n, find the cube root of n.

#### Note: We need to print the floor value of the result.

#### Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of one line. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n.

#### Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the cube root of n ( if the answer is in decimal, print its floor value).

#### Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 105

#### Example:
#### Input
2
3
8

#### Output
1
2
